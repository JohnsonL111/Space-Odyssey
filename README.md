# Hackademia-Space-Odyssey
For SOSY's Hackademia Web Dev Hackathon 

Inspiration:
The competition theme is outer space and therefore we decided to base our project on space… Jokes aside, knowing that there is a substantial amount of research and information on space, we found that learning about the topic is really hard. This is because the topic of space encompasses many different ideas and concepts about celestial bodies, theory, and exploration etc. Thus we decided that we wanted to make an interactive website about space that helps people more easily immerse themselves in this truly fascinating topic!

What it does:
A mobile-friendly educational website that provides information about outer space in a fun and interactive manner through an interactive solar system, fun facts, a discovery timeline and more!

How we built it:
Through blood, sweat, and tears (hehe BTS reference) we managed to scramble together a functional site using html5, css3, javascript and the jquery library.

Challenges we ran into:
Finding and debugging small errors that affect the formatting of the website (eg. weird margin appearing on the left side of the website). Generally it took 1 hr to find and delete the 1 line of code that was ruining the website. Also another thing was the problem with, ahem, “Time zones” (different sleep schedules go BRRR).

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
1) Actually finishing it. 2) Seeing the project come together after many hours of working on it. 3) Pulling through despite being coding newbies.

What we learned:
1) Html, css, javascript, jquery 2) The limits of our procrastination 3) The limits of our ability after procrastination 4) Team work through a virtual environment. 5) Syncing up with each other because we all had different schedules, priorities, etc.

What's next for Space Odyssey:
1) Extend slideshow 2) Add more easter eggs for the space exploration section 3) Add more quizzes to the site (also base them off rigor).
